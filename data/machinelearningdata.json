What is copyleft.org?  copyleft.org is a collaborative project to create and disseminate useful information, tutorial material, and new policy ideas regarding all forms of copyleft licensing. This site itself is licensed under a free and open license and has received contributions from experts around the world.  The Copyleft Guide and Tutorial  The primary project currently on this site is a tutorial book entitled [ copyleft and the GNU General Public License: A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide ]. This guide describes the policy motivations for copyleft, presents a detailed analysis of the text of various copyleft licenses, and gives examples and case studies of copyleft compliance situations.  Getting Involved  There are various ways to get involved with this project.  The primary copyleft.org website is a wiki, and we welcome helpful edits and additions. For the aforementioned guide and tutorial about GPL and other copyleft concepts, we seek help in the following ways:  Proposing Improvements to the Guide  Pull requests on copyleft.org's Kallithea site  are most welcome. If you're looking for something to fix, just grep the *.tex files for FIXME and you'll find plenty.  Many of them are simple and easy to do.  Some of them are writing, and some of them are formatting-related.  Joining Mailing Lists   * Subscribe to our low-traffic  announcements-only mailing list .   * Join discussion on our  primary mailing list, called discuss .  Who Contributes to copyleft.org?  This site is a project of  Software Freedom Conservancy .  The editor-in-chief of the guide is  Bradley M. Kuhn .  You can see the Git  commit log on the tutorial  to see who has contributed to it, and see the list of users who contribute to this Wiki. Each contributors' work is their own, and thus the opinions expressed in their contributions, IRC utterances, commit messages mailing list posts, and/or other fora provided by copyleft.org may not necessarily reflect the views of the contributors' employers and/or organizations sponsoring the project and/or organizations republishing copyleft.org's materials.  Generally speaking, unless stated otherwise, please assume that individuals contribute to copyleft.org in their personal capacity.  URLs You Can Memorize!  copyleft.org has many easy-to-remember URLs.  These are convenience URLs that you can memorize and give to people verbally to point them to the right part of The Guide (https://copyleft.org/guide/).  (Since the guide is very large, we thought a few easy-to-remember ways to tell people where to look would be helpful.)  Here are the primary ones:   copyleft.org  points to this page.  copyleft.guide  points to the guide itself.  compliance.guide  points to the  GPL Compliance Guide  section of the full Guide.  gpl.guide  points to the  Detailed Analysis of the GNU GPL and Related Licenses  section of the full Guide.   As time goes on, we'll add convenience URLs to refer to specific parts of the guide, which makes it easy to refer people to portions of the Guide.  Here are the ones that exist so far:  *  compliance.guide/pristine  points to the pristine example, the chapter entitled  ThinkPenguin Wireless Router: Excellent CCS .  *  compliance.guide/offer-for-source  points to the section regarding using the offer for source provisions in GPLv3\\u00c2\\u00a76(c) and/or GPLv2\\u00c2\\u00a73(b).
